<h2>AnimTrap Scroll Animation API</h2>

AnimTrap Scroll Features is exposed as a global variable, for now there are three methods available:

<ui>
    <li><code>init</code> - initialize AnimTrap Scroll  </li>
    <li><code>refresh</code> - recalculate all offsets and positions of elements (called on window resize)  </li>
    <li><code>refreshHard</code> - ireinit array with AnimTrap elements and trigger refresh (called on DOM changes that are related to aos elements) </li>
</ui>

<p>Example execution:</p>

<code>
    ANIM.refresh();
</code>

<p>By default ANIM is watching for DOM changes and if there are any new elements loaded asynchronously or when something is removed from DOM it calls <code>refreshHard</code> automatically. In browsers that don't support <code>MutationObserve</code> r like IE you might need to call <code>ANIM.refreshHard() </code>by yourself.</p>

<p>refresh method is called on window resize and so on, as it doesn't require to build new store with ANIMTRAP elements and should be as light as possible.</p>

<h2>Global settings</h2>

<p>If you don't want to change setting for each element separately, you can change it globally.</p>
<p>To do this, pass options object to <code>init()</code> function, like so:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
         &lt;script&gt;
             Anim.init({
                 offset: 200,
                 duration: 600,
                 easing: 'ease-in-sine',
                 delay: 100,
              });
         &lt;/script&gt;
    </code>
</pre>
